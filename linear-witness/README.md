# linear-witness

This package provides the `Linearly` witness token, which enables uniform resource allocation as described in the "[_LINEAR CONSTRAINTS: THE PROBLEM WITH SCOPES_](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2023-03-23-linear-constraints-linearly/)" by Arnaud Spiwack.
This is just a tentative workaround until [Linear Constraints](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/621) proposal is implemented in GHC.
