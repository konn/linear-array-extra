# linear-fft - Pure, in-place and parallel Fast Fourier Transformation

This package demonstrates the example usage of borrowable storable vectors from [`linear-array-extra`](../linear-array-extra) and parallelism combinators from [`linear-parallel`](../linear-parallel), by implementing na√Øve FFT.
